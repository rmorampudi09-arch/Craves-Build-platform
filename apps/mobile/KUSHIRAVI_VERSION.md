## Local Build Rule

Every future app change should be committed on this branch or a branch made from it. For every meaningful change:

1. Update the Android version when producing a new installable build.
2. Commit the change locally.
3. Rebuild the APK with `apps/mobile/scripts/build-kushiravi-release-apk.ps1`.
4. Keep the generated APK path in the handover notes.

Do not modify `origin/mobile-ui-rebuild-from-scratch` directly for KUSHIRAVI app work.
