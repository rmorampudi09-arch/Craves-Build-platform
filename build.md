**Repository:** `rmorampudi09-arch/Craves-Build-platform`  
**Authoritative branch:** `mobile-ui-rebuild-from-scratch`  
**Mobile workspace:** `apps/mobile`  
**Backend/APIM guard baseline:** `8a2444cde508ea2fb20cb9822397e55c29bd8c5f`  
**Implementation guide:** full 183-page `CRAVES_MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_v1.0`  
**Build policy:** code-level validation during phases; no APK per phase.

Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P91_CHEF_REALTIME_ORDER_RECONCILIATION.md`. GitHub Actions validation is not claimed because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted.
- **P92 — Chef Menu Contract Model:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; the complete currently approved five-route Chef Menu contract is typed, fail-closed parsed, source-tested, and centralized for mobile without inventing missing Guide capabilities. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P92_CHEF_MENU_CONTRACT_MODEL.md`. GitHub Actions validation is not claimed because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted.
- **P93 — Chef Menu:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real Chef Menu screen, client-side loaded-list search/filtering, availability mutation with rollback, Dashboard cache synchronization, and read-only item navigation are implemented at the exact P92 contract boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P93_CHEF_MENU_UI.md`.
- **P94 — Chef Add New Menu Item:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the focused create form, exact server-backed Save Draft/Add Item mutations, client validation, duplicate-tap guard, and Chef Menu/Dashboard cache synchronization are implemented at the current P92 contract boundary. Media/category metadata/incomplete-draft gaps remain explicit. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P94_CHEF_ADD_NEW_MENU_ITEM.md`.
- **P95 — Chef Menu Edit/Mutation Hardening:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; exact current-contract full replacement editing, server-returned cache reconciliation, duplicate-submit guarding, and unsaved-change protection are implemented. Image replacement and structured field-level server binding remain blocked by missing exact contracts/dependencies. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P95_CHEF_MENU_EDIT_MUTATION_HARDENING.md`.
- **P96 — Chef Analytics Contract Model:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; Guide-46 analytics capabilities are modeled fail-closed and the existing Orders/Earnings/Menu reads are classified only as reconciliation sources, not fabricated analytics. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P96_CHEF_ANALYTICS_CONTRACT_MODEL.md`.
- **P97 — Chef Analytics UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real Analytics tab structure, KPI/chart/item/report unavailable states, reference-range presentation, and accessibility semantics are implemented at the exact fail-closed P96 analytics boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P97_CHEF_ANALYTICS_UI.md`.
- **P98 — Chef Account Profile:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real `ChefProfileHome` hub, exact kitchen/business-status read, synchronized operational summary, safe role switch/logout, and explicit child-contract blockers are implemented at the exact current mobile/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P98_CHEF_ACCOUNT_PROFILE.md`.
- **P99 — Chef Edit Profile Domain/Form:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; exact current kitchen GET/PUT replacement form domain, draft persistence, validation, suspended read-only safety, duplicate-safe/abortable save model, and canonical Chef identity cache synchronization are implemented without inventing missing photo/cuisine/service-area/business-validation contracts.

- **P100 — Chef Edit Profile UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; the typed `ChefEditProfile` route, focused reference-aligned form UI, exact P99 field editing/save integration, dirty-back protection, suspended read-only state, loading/retry/error/mutation states, and explicit capability blockers are implemented without fabricating missing Guide contracts. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P100_CHEF_EDIT_PROFILE_UI.md`.
- **P101 — Chef Business Information Contract:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; exact current kitchen/application/proof-document sources are modeled fail-closed for mobile, sensitive storage/reviewer identifiers are excluded from the Business Information model, and missing approved-Chef document-maintenance/service-area/cuisine/payout contracts remain explicit. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P101_CHEF_BUSINESS_INFORMATION_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P102 — Chef Business Information UI/Document Flow:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-49 scope; the registered real Business Information screen, verification/document metadata presentation, supported kitchen edit navigation, independent loading/refresh/error states, and explicit fail-closed unsupported document/service-area/cuisine/payout actions are implemented at the exact P101 backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P102_CHEF_BUSINESS_INFORMATION_UI_DOCUMENT_FLOW.md`.
- **P103 — Chef Payout Contract and Eligibility:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; the exact Chef earning-ledger response is typed/validated as a non-runnable source boundary, while missing payout summary/balance/series/transactions/bank/eligibility/initiation/detail capabilities remain fail-closed. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P103_CHEF_PAYOUT_CONTRACT_ELIGIBILITY.md`.
- **P104 — Chef Payout History UI/Withdraw Flow:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-50 scope; the real typed/routed payout-history surface, Overview/Transactions local state, Profile/shared-Chef-menu entry paths, explicit unavailable financial states, and disabled fail-closed Withdraw Now action are implemented at the exact P103 contract boundary without fabricated money data or payout mutation. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P104_CHEF_PAYOUT_HISTORY_UI_WITHDRAW_FLOW.md`.
- **P105 — Chef Subscription Contract:** BLOCKED at full Guide/product-contract scope; a strict Guide-51 fail-closed Chef platform-subscription boundary is implemented, and the repository's customer meal-subscription routes are explicitly excluded from reuse. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P105_CHEF_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P106 — Chef Subscription Plan UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-51 scope; the real typed/routed Chef Subscription Plan screen, Profile entry path, reference-structure unavailable states, and non-runnable plan-management boundary are implemented at the exact P105 contract boundary without fabricated plan/pricing/benefit data. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P106_CHEF_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN_UI.md`.
- **P107 — Chef Preferences Contract:** COMPLETED at authorized contract-boundary scope; all Guide-52 preference state/ownership/integration requirements are modeled explicitly and fail closed while production persistence remains undefined. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P107_CHEF_PREFERENCES_CONTRACT.md`.

**Current executed phase:** **P107 — Chef Preferences Contract**.

**P107 phase start commit:** `19eea9bb0cc7f98a3bfa72d94d5b29835a137864`  
**P107 implementation/code + evidence commit:** `c16bfa518a3ce3f42d0e2f8ff26cbb9efc6cdb76`

### P107 implemented boundary

- Re-read `agent.md`, `build.md`, `phases.md`, `plan.md`, full Guide Reference 52, P106 evidence, and current Customer Settings precedents; implemented only P107 and did not start P108.
- Added exact Guide-52 state keys for language, currency, notification preferences, appearance mode, default preparation time, Auto Accept Orders, reminder interval, and storage settings, plus the explicit privacy boundary required by P107 acceptance.
- Assigned explicit ownership to every capability across Chef account, Chef shell runtime, Chef orders, notification platform, device storage, and identity/security boundaries.
- Recorded the required Chef preferences read/write, push registration, feature flags, language/currency metadata, OS notification permission, shell propagation, order eligibility, privacy/security, and storage/cache mechanisms without inventing endpoints or values.
- Kept persistence truthful as `undefined`, UI exposure `blocked`, and every preference write `allowed: false` until exact production mechanisms exist.
- Explicitly excluded Customer Settings from being treated as Chef preference persistence because customer-scoped/device-local behavior cannot establish Chef role ownership or Guide-52 server/runtime semantics.
- Codified the Guide safety rules: Auto Accept requires confirmation + eligibility + new-orders-only scope; notification controls require OS permission reconciliation and system-settings recovery; storage actions require confirmation and must preserve authentication and unsynced drafts.
- Added focused source tests for state coverage, ownership, mechanism coverage, fail-closed writes/UI exposure, safety policies, and no fabricated endpoint/local-storage/currency/locale values.
- No P108 screen, route, navigator, Profile row, customer UI, backend, APIM, OpenAPI, database, infrastructure, dependency, provider, or secret change was made.

### P107 changed code files

- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefPreferences/domain/chefPreferencesContract.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefPreferences/domain/chefPreferencesContract.test.ts`

Evidence/ledger:

- `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P107_CHEF_PREFERENCES_CONTRACT.md`
- `build.md`

### P107 validation / guard state

- Focused Jest test source is committed for the P107 contract boundary; Jest execution is not claimed from this connector-only implementation run.
- GitHub Actions are intentionally not claimed as a P107 pass/fail signal because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted and the user explicitly authorized continuing without it.
- No dependency was added and no UI/runtime integration was introduced in this contract phase.
- The P107 evidence records all retained contract gaps rather than disguising them with device-local persistence or fake success.
- The `phases.md` stop/go rule remains active: **do not proceed to P108 UI while Chef settings persistence is undefined.**

### P107 retained blockers instead of fabricated Guide capabilities

1. No approved authenticated Chef preferences read/update contract.
2. No Chef notification-preference persistence reconciled with push registration and OS permission state.
3. No app-wide Chef localization preference propagation contract.
4. No app-wide Chef currency metadata/preference propagation contract.
5. No app-wide Chef appearance/theme propagation contract.
6. No authoritative default-preparation-time option/persistence contract.
7. No Auto Accept persistence, eligibility, and safe activation contract.
8. No authoritative reminder-interval persistence/metadata contract.
9. No safe Chef storage/cache-management contract protecting authentication and unsynced drafts.
10. No Chef App Preferences privacy/security settings contract.

**Next phase in sequence:** **P108 — Chef App Preferences UI — NOT STARTED**.

**Next phase authorization:** **NONE AUTHORIZED while Chef settings persistence remains undefined.**

**Required action:** Stop after P107. Do not pre-implement P108 until the P107 persistence gate is resolved and explicit user direction is given.

## 3. Handoff

Before any P108 work, re-read `plan.md`, `phases.md`, `agent.md`, this ledger, the full 183-page implementation guide, and P107 evidence. P107 intentionally leaves Chef preference persistence fail-closed because no approved end-to-end preference read/update/runtime contract exists. Do not bypass the P107 stop/go rule with device-local fake success, invented preference endpoints, hard-coded language/currency/preparation/reminder values, or local Auto Accept behavior. P108 is not authorized until persistence is established and the user explicitly authorizes that phase.
