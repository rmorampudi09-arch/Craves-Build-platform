# CRAVES Mobile Build / Implementation Ledger

**Purpose:** Authoritative living control record for the current mobile rebuild. Detailed historical evidence remains under `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/`; this compact ledger does not reclassify earlier phase evidence.

**Repository:** `rmorampudi09-arch/Craves-Build-platform`  
**Authoritative branch:** `mobile-ui-rebuild-from-scratch`  
**Mobile workspace:** `apps/mobile`  
**Backend/APIM guard baseline:** `8a2444cde508ea2fb20cb9822397e55c29bd8c5f`  
**Implementation guide:** full 183-page `CRAVES_MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_v1.0`  
**Build policy:** code-level validation during phases; no APK per phase.

## 1. Current Control State

- **P00–P56:** retain the exact DONE/PARTIAL/BLOCKED state recorded in their dedicated evidence. Do not reinterpret historical partial phases as DONE.
- **P57–P59:** DONE.
- **P60–P73:** retain their recorded PARTIAL/BLOCKED exact-contract boundaries in dedicated evidence.
- **P74:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.
- **P75–P79:** retain recorded PARTIAL states and blockers.
- **P80 — Chef Root Shell and Role Isolation:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.
- **P81 — Chef Shared Header/Badge/Operational Counters:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.
- **P82 — Chef Dashboard Contract Model:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.
- **P83 — Chef Dashboard UI:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.
- **P84 — Chef Order Detail Contract:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P84_CHEF_ORDER_DETAIL_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P85 — Chef New Order Detail UI/Actions:** DONE at authorized code scope. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P85_CHEF_NEW_ORDER_DETAIL_UI_ACTIONS.md`. CI remains externally blocked before runner startup by the recorded GitHub runner/account condition.
- **P86 — Chef Order Tab Query Architecture:** PARTIAL at full product-contract scope; mobile architecture is implemented at the exact currently available backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P86_CHEF_ORDER_TAB_QUERY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **P87 — Chef Preparing Orders:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; implemented and correctness-hardened to the exact currently authorized mobile/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P87_CHEF_PREPARING_ORDERS.md`.
- **P88 — Chef Orders — New:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; implemented to the exact currently available mobile/backend contract boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P88_CHEF_ORDERS_NEW.md`.
- **P89 — Chef Ready for Pickup:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; Ready UI/read/revalidation/reconciliation and cross-tab Ready entry are implemented to the exact current Chef/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P89_CHEF_READY_FOR_PICKUP.md`.
- **P90 — Chef Completed Orders:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; bounded read-only Completed history/detail and all-tab Completed entry are implemented to the exact current Chef/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P90_CHEF_COMPLETED_ORDERS.md`.
- **P91 — Chef Realtime/Near-Realtime Order Event Reconciliation:** DONE at authorized code scope; near-real-time refetch/reconciliation is implemented through the existing exact Chef orders contract without inventing a push transport. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P91_CHEF_REALTIME_ORDER_RECONCILIATION.md`. GitHub Actions validation is not claimed because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted.
- **P92 — Chef Menu Contract Model:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; the complete currently approved five-route Chef Menu contract is typed, fail-closed parsed, source-tested, and centralized for mobile without inventing missing Guide capabilities. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P92_CHEF_MENU_CONTRACT_MODEL.md`. GitHub Actions validation is not claimed because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted.
- **P93 — Chef Menu:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real Chef Menu screen, client-side loaded-list search/filtering, availability mutation with rollback, Dashboard cache synchronization, and read-only item navigation are implemented at the exact P92 contract boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P93_CHEF_MENU_UI.md`.
- **P94 — Chef Add New Menu Item:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the focused create form, exact server-backed Save Draft/Add Item mutations, client validation, duplicate-tap guard, and Chef Menu/Dashboard cache synchronization are implemented at the current P92 contract boundary. Media/category metadata/incomplete-draft gaps remain explicit. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P94_CHEF_ADD_NEW_MENU_ITEM.md`.
- **P95 — Chef Menu Edit/Mutation Hardening:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; exact current-contract full replacement editing, server-returned cache reconciliation, duplicate-submit guarding, and unsaved-change protection are implemented. Image replacement and structured field-level server binding remain blocked by missing exact contracts/dependencies. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P95_CHEF_MENU_EDIT_MUTATION_HARDENING.md`.
- **P96 — Chef Analytics Contract Model:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; Guide-46 analytics capabilities are modeled fail-closed and the existing Orders/Earnings/Menu reads are classified only as reconciliation sources, not fabricated analytics. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P96_CHEF_ANALYTICS_CONTRACT_MODEL.md`.
- **P97 — Chef Analytics UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real Analytics tab structure, KPI/chart/item/report unavailable states, reference-range presentation, and accessibility semantics are implemented at the exact fail-closed P96 analytics boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P97_CHEF_ANALYTICS_UI.md`.
- **P98 — Chef Account Profile:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real `ChefProfileHome` hub, exact kitchen/business-status read, synchronized operational summary, safe role switch/logout, and explicit child-contract blockers are implemented at the exact current mobile/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P98_CHEF_ACCOUNT_PROFILE.md`.
- **P99 — Chef Edit Profile Domain/Form:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; exact current kitchen GET/PUT replacement form domain, draft persistence, validation, suspended read-only safety, duplicate-safe/abortable save model, and canonical Chef identity cache synchronization are implemented without inventing missing photo/cuisine/service-area/business-validation contracts. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P99_CHEF_EDIT_PROFILE_DOMAIN_FORM.md`.
- **P100 — Chef Edit Profile UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; the typed `ChefEditProfile` route, focused reference-aligned form UI, exact P99 field editing/save integration, dirty-back protection, suspended read-only state, loading/retry/error/mutation states, and explicit capability blockers are implemented without fabricating missing Guide contracts. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P100_CHEF_EDIT_PROFILE_UI.md`.
- **P101 — Chef Business Information Contract:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; exact current kitchen/application/proof-document sources are modeled fail-closed for mobile, sensitive storage/reviewer identifiers are excluded from the Business Information model, and missing approved-Chef document-maintenance/service-area/cuisine/payout contracts remain explicit. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P101_CHEF_BUSINESS_INFORMATION_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P102 — Chef Business Information UI/Document Flow:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-49 scope; the registered real Business Information screen, verification/document metadata presentation, supported kitchen edit navigation, independent loading/refresh/error states, and explicit fail-closed unsupported document/service-area/cuisine/payout actions are implemented at the exact P101 backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P102_CHEF_BUSINESS_INFORMATION_UI_DOCUMENT_FLOW.md`.
- **P103 — Chef Payout Contract and Eligibility:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; the exact Chef earning-ledger response is typed/validated as a non-runnable source boundary, while missing payout summary/balance/series/transactions/bank/eligibility/initiation/detail capabilities remain fail-closed. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P103_CHEF_PAYOUT_CONTRACT_ELIGIBILITY.md`.
- **P104 — Chef Payout History UI/Withdraw Flow:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-50 scope; the real typed/routed payout-history surface, Overview/Transactions local state, Profile/shared-Chef-menu entry paths, explicit unavailable financial states, and disabled fail-closed Withdraw Now action are implemented at the exact P103 contract boundary without fabricated money data or payout mutation. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P104_CHEF_PAYOUT_HISTORY_UI_WITHDRAW_FLOW.md`.
- **P105 — Chef Subscription Contract:** BLOCKED at full Guide/product-contract scope; a strict Guide-51 fail-closed Chef platform-subscription boundary is implemented, and the repository's customer meal-subscription routes are explicitly excluded from reuse. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P105_CHEF_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P106 — Chef Subscription Plan UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-51 scope; the real typed/routed Chef Subscription Plan screen, Profile entry path, reference-structure unavailable states, and non-runnable plan-management boundary are implemented at the exact P105 contract boundary without fabricated plan/pricing/benefit data. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P106_CHEF_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN_UI.md`.

**Current executed phase:** **P106 — Chef Subscription Plan UI**.

**P106 implementation/code end:** `2803914efaffd65f000a9e6d44c9889d23433ebd`  
**P106 evidence commit:** `a492060aca6a38da3521df2c2717221a3e0d6c62`

### P106 implemented boundary

- Re-read `agent.md`, `build.md`, `phases.md`, `plan.md`, full Guide Reference 51, and the P105 contract boundary; implemented only P106 and did not start P107.
- Registered typed route `ChefSubscriptionPlan` inside the existing Chef Profile stack and wired the existing Profile `Subscription plan` row to it.
- Kept the screen inside the Profile tab navigator so the existing Chef bottom navigation remains stable; no Customer cart/view-cart state was added.
- Reused `ChefHeader`, design tokens, shared icons, safe-area handling, and the established Chef navigation architecture.
- Added a P106 presentation-boundary model derived from the P105 fail-closed contract instead of creating a parallel API/service architecture.
- Implemented truthfully representable Reference-51 structure: current-plan banner, plan catalogue unavailable state, annual-savings unavailable banner, comparison capability section, manage-plan CTA boundary, change/cancel/renew explanation actions, support CTA boundary, and back/Profile navigation.
- Kept all server-owned plan state empty: current plan, billing cycle, pricing, eligibility, subscription status, annual savings, plan catalogue items, and feature matrix entries.
- Kept high-impact `changePlan`, `cancelPlan`, and `renewPlan` actions non-runnable with `allowed: false`; no confirmation/proration/effective-date/idempotency semantics were invented.
- Did not reuse customer meal-subscription/admin sellable-plan endpoints, did not fabricate Chef endpoints, and did not turn reference-only Basic/Premium/Pro names, prices, currency, tax, benefits, eligibility, or billing-provider state into runtime data.
- No backend, APIM, OpenAPI, database, infrastructure, dependency, provider, secret, customer-screen, or unrelated Chef-flow change was made.

### P106 changed code files

- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefSubscription/domain/chefSubscriptionPlanBoundary.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefSubscription/domain/chefSubscriptionPlanBoundary.test.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefSubscription/screens/ChefSubscriptionPlanScreen.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/app/navigation/types.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/app/navigation/ChefRootNavigator.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefProfile/screens/ChefProfileScreen.tsx`

Evidence/ledger:

- `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P106_CHEF_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN_UI.md`
- `build.md`

### P106 validation / guard state

- `GitHub.compare_commits` from phase-start HEAD `bba0543da67b2b2571c70afb45c129d7c296784a` through code end `2803914efaffd65f000a9e6d44c9889d23433ebd` is fast-forward by six commits and contains exactly the six P106 code/test/navigation/profile files listed above.
- The existing `ChefProfileScreen.tsx` diff is limited to the subscription-row boundary copy and `ChefSubscriptionPlan` navigation branch; unrelated Profile logic/styles remain unchanged.
- Source review confirms the route is registered in the existing Chef Profile stack and inherits Chef bottom navigation.
- Focused test source covers empty authoritative plan values, disabled change/cancel/renew actions, blocked support destination, and absence of reference-only tier/currency values.
- GitHub Actions are intentionally not claimed as a P106 pass/fail signal because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted and the user explicitly instructed continuing without it.
- Full workspace dependency installation, strict TypeScript execution, ESLint execution, Jest execution, production Android bundle/build, emulator/device behavior, and Reference-51 pixel-level visual validation are **not recorded as passing or failing for P106** from this connector-only phase.
- P106 is **PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-51 scope** because authoritative Chef subscription data/mutation/billing contracts still do not exist. The UI is intentionally transparent and non-runnable where those contracts are required.

### P106 retained blockers instead of fabricated Guide capabilities

1. No approved Chef platform plan catalogue/current-plan contract.
2. No authoritative pricing/currency/tax/billing-cycle/annual-savings contract.
3. No Chef plan eligibility contract.
4. No feature-entitlement matrix contract.
5. No subscription pending/failed/grace-period/cancelled/effective-date state model.
6. No upgrade/downgrade confirmation/proration/idempotency contract.
7. No Chef platform cancellation contract.
8. No renewal/reactivation contract.
9. No Chef platform billing-provider integration contract.
10. No approved Chef subscription-specific support destination.

**Next phase in sequence:** **P107 — Chef Preferences Contract — NOT STARTED**.

**Next phase authorization:** **NONE AUTHORIZED**.

**Required action:** Stop after P106. Do not pre-implement P107 without explicit user direction.

## 3. Handoff

Before any P107 work, read `plan.md`, `phases.md`, `agent.md`, this ledger, the full 183-page implementation guide, and P106 evidence. Preserve the P105/P106 ownership boundary: the existing `/api/v1/subscriptions*` and `/api/v1/admin/subscription*` contracts are customer meal-plan/sellable-plan contracts and must not be presented as the Chef's CRAVES platform membership. Do not invent current plan, Basic/Premium/Pro pricing/benefits, entitlements, eligibility, proration, effective dates, billing-provider behavior, or change/cancel/renew routes. Do not alter backend/APIM without explicit authority, and do not advance beyond the single explicitly authorized phase.
