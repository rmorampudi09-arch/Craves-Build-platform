# CRAVES Mobile Build / Implementation Ledger

**Purpose:** Authoritative living control record for the current mobile rebuild. Detailed historical evidence remains under `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/`; this compact ledger does not reclassify earlier phase evidence.

**Repository:** `rmorampudi09-arch/Craves-Build-platform`  
**Authoritative branch:** `mobile-ui-rebuild-from-scratch`  
**Mobile workspace:** `apps/mobile`  
**Backend/APIM guard baseline:** `8a2444cde508ea2fb20cb9822397e55c29bd8c5f`  
**Implementation guide:** full 183-page `CRAVES_MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_v1.0`  
**Build policy:** code-level validation during phases; no APK per phase.

- **P57–P59:** DONE.
- **P60–P73:** retain their recorded PARTIAL/BLOCKED exact-contract boundaries in dedicated evidence.
- **P74:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.
- **P75–P79:** retain recorded PARTIAL states and blockers.
- **P80 — Chef Root Shell and Role Isolation:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.

- **P85 — Chef New Order Detail UI/Actions:** DONE at authorized code scope. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P85_CHEF_NEW_ORDER_DETAIL_UI_ACTIONS.md`. CI remains externally blocked before runner startup by the recorded GitHub runner/account condition.
- **P86 — Chef Order Tab Query Architecture:** PARTIAL at full product-contract scope; mobile architecture is implemented at the exact currently available backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P86_CHEF_ORDER_TAB_QUERY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **P87 — Chef Preparing Orders:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; implemented and correctness-hardened to the exact currently authorized mobile/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P87_CHEF_PREPARING_ORDERS.md`.
- **P88 — Chef Orders — New:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; implemented to the exact currently available mobile/backend contract boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P88_CHEF_ORDERS_NEW.md`.

- **P91 — Chef Realtime/Near-Realtime Order Event Reconciliation:** DONE at authorized code scope; near-real-time refetch/reconciliation is implemented through the existing exact Chef orders contract without inventing a push transport. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P91_CHEF_REALTIME_ORDER_RECONCILIATION.md`. GitHub Actions validation is not claimed because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted.
- **P92 — Chef Menu Contract Model:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; the complete currently approved five-route Chef Menu contract is typed, fail-closed parsed, source-tested, and centralized for mobile without inventing missing Guide capabilities. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P92_CHEF_MENU_CONTRACT_MODEL.md`. GitHub Actions validation is not claimed because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted.
- **P93 — Chef Menu:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real Chef Menu screen, client-side loaded-list search/filtering, availability mutation with rollback, Dashboard cache synchronization, and read-only item navigation are implemented at the exact P92 contract boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P93_CHEF_MENU_UI.md`.
- **P94 — Chef Add New Menu Item:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the focused create form, exact server-backed Save Draft/Add Item mutations, client validation, duplicate-tap guard, and Chef Menu/Dashboard cache synchronization are implemented at the current P92 contract boundary. Media/category metadata/incomplete-draft gaps remain explicit. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P94_CHEF_ADD_NEW_MENU_ITEM.md`.
- **P95 — Chef Menu Edit/Mutation Hardening:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; exact current-contract full replacement editing, server-returned cache reconciliation, duplicate-submit guarding, and unsaved-change protection are implemented. Image replacement and structured field-level server binding remain blocked by missing exact contracts/dependencies. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P95_CHEF_MENU_EDIT_MUTATION_HARDENING.md`.
- **P96 — Chef Analytics Contract Model:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; Guide-46 analytics capabilities are modeled fail-closed and the existing Orders/Earnings/Menu reads are classified only as reconciliation sources, not fabricated analytics. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P96_CHEF_ANALYTICS_CONTRACT_MODEL.md`.
- **P97 — Chef Analytics UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real Analytics tab structure, KPI/chart/item/report unavailable states, reference-range presentation, and accessibility semantics are implemented at the exact fail-closed P96 analytics boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P97_CHEF_ANALYTICS_UI.md`.
- **P98 — Chef Account Profile:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real `ChefProfileHome` hub, exact kitchen/business-status read, synchronized operational summary, safe role switch/logout, and explicit child-contract blockers are implemented at the exact current mobile/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P98_CHEF_ACCOUNT_PROFILE.md`.
- **P99 — Chef Edit Profile Domain/Form:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; exact current kitchen GET/PUT replacement form domain, draft persistence, validation, suspended read-only safety, duplicate-safe/abortable save model, and canonical Chef identity cache synchronization are implemented without inventing missing photo/cuisine/service-area/business-validation contracts. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P99_CHEF_EDIT_PROFILE_DOMAIN_FORM.md`.
- **P100 — Chef Edit Profile UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; the typed `ChefEditProfile` route, focused reference-aligned form UI, exact P99 field editing/save integration, dirty-back protection, suspended read-only state, loading/retry/error/mutation states, and explicit capability blockers are implemented without fabricating missing Guide contracts. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P100_CHEF_EDIT_PROFILE_UI.md`.
- **P101 — Chef Business Information Contract:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; exact current kitchen/application/proof-document sources are modeled fail-closed for mobile, sensitive storage/reviewer identifiers are excluded from the Business Information model, and missing approved-Chef document-maintenance/service-area/cuisine/payout contracts remain explicit. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P101_CHEF_BUSINESS_INFORMATION_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P102 — Chef Business Information UI/Document Flow:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-49 scope; the registered real Business Information screen, verification/document metadata presentation, supported kitchen edit navigation, independent loading/refresh/error states, and explicit fail-closed unsupported document/service-area/cuisine/payout actions are implemented at the exact P101 backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P102_CHEF_BUSINESS_INFORMATION_UI_DOCUMENT_FLOW.md`.
- **P103 — Chef Payout Contract and Eligibility:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; the exact Chef earning-ledger response is typed/validated as a non-runnable source boundary, while missing payout summary/balance/series/transactions/bank/eligibility/initiation/detail capabilities remain fail-closed. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P103_CHEF_PAYOUT_CONTRACT_ELIGIBILITY.md`.
- **P104 — Chef Payout History UI/Withdraw Flow:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-50 scope; the real typed/routed payout-history surface, Overview/Transactions local state, Profile/shared-Chef-menu entry paths, explicit unavailable financial states, and disabled fail-closed Withdraw Now action are implemented at the exact P103 contract boundary without fabricated money data or payout mutation. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P104_CHEF_PAYOUT_HISTORY_UI_WITHDRAW_FLOW.md`.
- **P105 — Chef Subscription Contract:** BLOCKED at full Guide/product-contract scope; a strict Guide-51 fail-closed Chef platform-subscription boundary is implemented, and the repository's customer meal-subscription routes are explicitly excluded from reuse. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P105_CHEF_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P106 — Chef Subscription Plan UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-51 scope; the real typed/routed Chef Subscription Plan screen, Profile entry path, reference-structure unavailable states, and non-runnable plan-management boundary are implemented at the exact P105 contract boundary without fabricated plan/pricing/benefit data. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P106_CHEF_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN_UI.md`.
- **P107 — Chef Preferences Contract:** COMPLETED at authorized contract-boundary scope; all Guide-52 preference state/ownership/integration requirements are modeled explicitly and fail closed while production persistence remains undefined. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P107_CHEF_PREFERENCES_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P108 — Chef App Preferences UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-52 scope; a real typed/routed Profile-owned preference screen and fail-closed modal/control boundary are implemented while the P107 persistence/runtime gaps remain explicit. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P108_CHEF_APP_PREFERENCES_UI.md`.

**Current executed phase:** **P108 — Chef App Preferences UI**.

**P108 implementation/code + evidence commit:** `879fa8b525e1b7960bede7bdec80329e0b2fa8a3`

### P108 implemented boundary

- Re-read `agent.md`, `build.md`, `phases.md`, `plan.md`, the full Guide Reference 52, P107 evidence/contract, and the current Chef Profile/navigation implementation; implemented only P108 and did not start P109.
- Added the typed `ChefAppPreferences` route to the existing Chef Profile stack and connected the existing Profile -> App preferences row to it.
- Added a real `ChefAppPreferencesScreen` using the existing Chef header, Profile-stack ownership, design tokens, safe-area handling, and retained bottom navigation.
- Added Guide-52 presentation groups for Notifications, Language & region, Recipes/order preferences, Privacy, Reminder interval, Data & storage, and Appearance.
- Derived every visible control from the P107 contract boundary; values remain `null`, writes remain `false`, and interactions are explanation-only until production persistence/runtime contracts exist.
- Added explicit unavailable UI treatment for Auto Accept Orders and system appearance rather than presenting misleading working switches.
- Added a dismissible explanation modal for unavailable capabilities; closing it creates no local preference draft and no placeholder save.
- Did not create Chef preference AsyncStorage/MMKV state, fake endpoints, hard-coded language/currency/preparation/reminder options, local Auto Accept behavior, fake notification writes, destructive storage controls, or a non-functional Save action.
- Customer UI, backend, APIM, OpenAPI, database, infrastructure, dependencies, providers, secrets, and P109 were not changed.

### P108 changed code files

- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefPreferences/domain/chefPreferencesUiBoundary.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefPreferences/domain/chefPreferencesUiBoundary.test.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefPreferences/screens/ChefAppPreferencesScreen.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/app/navigation/types.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/app/navigation/ChefRootNavigator.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefProfile/screens/ChefProfileScreen.tsx`

Evidence/ledger:

- `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P108_CHEF_APP_PREFERENCES_UI.md`
- `build.md`

### P108 validation / guard state

- TypeScript syntax transpile validation passed for the reconstructed P108 TS/TSX change set.
- The P108 domain/UI boundary passed a focused strict TypeScript check against the P107-compatible type surface and direct runtime assertions for 7 sections, 9 fail-closed controls, modal open/close behavior, and absence of fabricated option values.
- Focused Jest source is committed, but full repository Jest/typecheck/build execution is not claimed from this connector-only run.
- GitHub Actions are intentionally not used as a P108 acceptance signal because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted and the user explicitly authorized continuing without it.
- Reference-image/device visual certification is not claimed, so P108 remains PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope.

### P108 retained blockers instead of fabricated Guide capabilities

1. No approved authenticated Chef preferences read/update contract.
2. No Chef notification-preference persistence reconciled with push registration and OS permission state.
3. No app-wide Chef localization preference propagation contract.
4. No app-wide Chef currency metadata/preference propagation contract.
5. No app-wide Chef appearance/theme propagation contract.
6. No authoritative default-preparation-time option/persistence contract.
7. No Auto Accept persistence, eligibility, confirmation, and safe new-orders-only activation contract.
8. No authoritative reminder-interval persistence/metadata contract.
9. No safe Chef storage/cache-management contract protecting authentication and unsynced drafts.
10. No Chef App Preferences privacy/security settings contract.
11. No reference-image visual verification/full Android device validation in this run.

**Next phase in sequence:** **P109 — NOT STARTED**.

**Next phase authorization:** **NONE AUTHORIZED in this run.**

**Required action:** Stop after P108. Do not pre-implement P109.

## 3. Handoff

Before any P109 work, re-read `plan.md`, `phases.md`, `agent.md`, this ledger, the full implementation guide, and the P107/P108 evidence. P108 intentionally keeps all preference writes fail-closed because no approved end-to-end Chef preference read/update/runtime contract exists. Do not bypass those retained blockers with device-local fake success, invented preference endpoints, hard-coded language/currency/preparation/reminder values, local Auto Accept behavior, unsafe cache clearing, or pretend save states. P109 is not authorized in this run.
