**Repository:** `rmorampudi09-arch/Craves-Build-platform`  
**Authoritative branch:** `mobile-ui-rebuild-from-scratch`  
**Mobile workspace:** `apps/mobile`  
**Backend/APIM guard baseline:** `8a2444cde508ea2fb20cb9822397e55c29bd8c5f`  
**Implementation guide:** full 183-page `CRAVES_MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_v1.0`  
**Build policy:** code-level validation during phases; no APK per phase.

## 1. Current Control State

- **P00–P56:** retain the exact DONE/PARTIAL/BLOCKED state recorded in their dedicated evidence. Do not reinterpret historical partial phases as DONE.
- **P57–P59:** DONE.
- **P60–P73:** retain their recorded PARTIAL/BLOCKED exact-contract boundaries in dedicated evidence.
- **P74:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.
- **P75–P79:** retain recorded PARTIAL states and blockers.
- **P80 — Chef Root Shell and Role Isolation:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.

- **P82 — Chef Dashboard Contract Model:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.
- **P83 — Chef Dashboard UI:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope.
- **P84 — Chef Order Detail Contract:** DONE at authorized code/CI scope. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P84_CHEF_ORDER_DETAIL_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P85 — Chef New Order Detail UI/Actions:** DONE at authorized code scope. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P85_CHEF_NEW_ORDER_DETAIL_UI_ACTIONS.md`. CI remains externally blocked before runner startup by the recorded GitHub runner/account condition.
- **P86 — Chef Order Tab Query Architecture:** PARTIAL at full product-contract scope; mobile architecture is implemented at the exact currently available backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P86_CHEF_ORDER_TAB_QUERY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **P87 — Chef Preparing Orders:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; implemented and correctness-hardened to the exact currently authorized mobile/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P87_CHEF_PREPARING_ORDERS.md`.
- **P88 — Chef Orders — New:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; implemented to the exact currently available mobile/backend contract boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P88_CHEF_ORDERS_NEW.md`.
- **P89 — Chef Ready for Pickup:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; Ready UI/read/revalidation/reconciliation and cross-tab Ready entry are implemented to the exact current Chef/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P89_CHEF_READY_FOR_PICKUP.md`.
- **P90 — Chef Completed Orders:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; bounded read-only Completed history/detail and all-tab Completed entry are implemented to the exact current Chef/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P90_CHEF_COMPLETED_ORDERS.md`.
- **P91 — Chef Realtime/Near-Realtime Order Event Reconciliation:** DONE at authorized code scope; near-real-time refetch/reconciliation is implemented through the existing exact Chef orders contract without inventing a push transport. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P91_CHEF_REALTIME_ORDER_RECONCILIATION.md`. GitHub Actions validation is not claimed because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted.
- **P92 — Chef Menu Contract Model:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; the complete currently approved five-route Chef Menu contract is typed, fail-closed parsed, source-tested, and centralized for mobile without inventing missing Guide capabilities. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P92_CHEF_MENU_CONTRACT_MODEL.md`. GitHub Actions validation is not claimed because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted.
- **P93 — Chef Menu:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real Chef Menu screen, client-side loaded-list search/filtering, availability mutation with rollback, Dashboard cache synchronization, and read-only item navigation are implemented at the exact P92 contract boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P93_CHEF_MENU_UI.md`.
- **P94 — Chef Add New Menu Item:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the focused create form, exact server-backed Save Draft/Add Item mutations, client validation, duplicate-tap guard, and Chef Menu/Dashboard cache synchronization are implemented at the current P92 contract boundary. Media/category metadata/incomplete-draft gaps remain explicit. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P94_CHEF_ADD_NEW_MENU_ITEM.md`.
- **P95 — Chef Menu Edit/Mutation Hardening:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; exact current-contract full replacement editing, server-returned cache reconciliation, duplicate-submit guarding, and unsaved-change protection are implemented. Image replacement and structured field-level server binding remain blocked by missing exact contracts/dependencies. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P95_CHEF_MENU_EDIT_MUTATION_HARDENING.md`.
- **P96 — Chef Analytics Contract Model:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; Guide-46 analytics capabilities are modeled fail-closed and the existing Orders/Earnings/Menu reads are classified only as reconciliation sources, not fabricated analytics. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P96_CHEF_ANALYTICS_CONTRACT_MODEL.md`.
- **P97 — Chef Analytics UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real Analytics tab structure, KPI/chart/item/report unavailable states, reference-range presentation, and accessibility semantics are implemented at the exact fail-closed P96 analytics boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P97_CHEF_ANALYTICS_UI.md`.
- **P98 — Chef Account Profile:** PARTIAL at full Guide scope; the real `ChefProfileHome` hub, exact kitchen/business-status read, synchronized operational summary, safe role switch/logout, and explicit child-contract blockers are implemented at the exact current mobile/backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P98_CHEF_ACCOUNT_PROFILE.md`.
- **P99 — Chef Edit Profile Domain/Form:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; exact current kitchen GET/PUT replacement form domain, draft persistence, validation, suspended read-only safety, duplicate-safe/abortable save model, and canonical Chef identity cache synchronization are implemented without inventing missing photo/cuisine/service-area/business-validation contracts. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P99_CHEF_EDIT_PROFILE_DOMAIN_FORM.md`.
- **P100 — Chef Edit Profile UI:** PARTIAL at full Guide completion scope; the typed `ChefEditProfile` route, focused reference-aligned form UI, exact P99 field editing/save integration, dirty-back protection, suspended read-only state, loading/retry/error/mutation states, and explicit capability blockers are implemented without fabricating missing Guide contracts. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P100_CHEF_EDIT_PROFILE_UI.md`.
- **P101 — Chef Business Information Contract:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; exact current kitchen/application/proof-document sources are modeled fail-closed for mobile, sensitive storage/reviewer identifiers are excluded from the Business Information model, and missing approved-Chef document-maintenance/service-area/cuisine/payout contracts remain explicit. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P101_CHEF_BUSINESS_INFORMATION_CONTRACT.md`.
- **P102 — Chef Business Information UI/Document Flow:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-49 scope; the registered real Business Information screen, verification/document metadata presentation, supported kitchen edit navigation, independent loading/refresh/error states, and explicit fail-closed unsupported document/service-area/cuisine/payout actions are implemented at the exact P101 backend boundary. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P102_CHEF_BUSINESS_INFORMATION_UI_DOCUMENT_FLOW.md`.
- **P103 — Chef Payout Contract and Eligibility:** PARTIAL at full Guide/product-contract scope; the exact Chef earning-ledger response is typed/validated as a non-runnable source boundary, while missing payout summary/balance/series/transactions/bank/eligibility/initiation/detail capabilities remain fail-closed. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P103_CHEF_PAYOUT_CONTRACT_ELIGIBILITY.md`.
- **P104 — Chef Payout History UI/Withdraw Flow:** PARTIAL at full Guide Reference-50 scope; the real typed/routed payout-history surface, Overview/Transactions local state, Profile/shared-Chef-menu entry paths, explicit unavailable financial states, and disabled fail-closed Withdraw Now action are implemented at the exact P103 contract boundary without fabricated money data or payout mutation. Evidence: `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P104_CHEF_PAYOUT_HISTORY_UI_WITHDRAW_FLOW.md`.

**Current executed phase:** **P104 — Chef Payout History UI/Withdraw Flow**.

**P104 phase start commit:** `3c1981f7d5185d241d0d2b9b0d85a5d6edc753d3`  
**P104 implementation/code end:** `9c8f1780590e0004199694d1128a6b924d911544`

### P104 implemented boundary

- Re-read the authorized control docs and full Guide Reference 50 and implemented only P104; no P105 subscription work was started.
- Added `ChefPayoutHistory` to the existing typed Chef Profile stack and registered the real screen without creating a second navigator or shell.
- Connected the existing Profile `Payouts` row and shared Chef menu to the Payout History route; the standard Chef bottom tabs remain visible and customer cart state remains absent.
- Added a Reference-50-aligned protected payout surface with Earnings Overview/Transactions tabs, balance/earnings/paid-out KPI structure, recent payout, payout trend, date-range control, transaction state, help/refresh explanations, and Withdraw Now.
- Server-owned financial values stay empty/unavailable because the current repository lacks approved payout summary, balance, trend, transaction, bank, eligibility, initiation, and detail contracts.
- Added a small presentation/domain boundary carrying real selected-tab state while keeping date range, summary, available balance, series, and transaction page explicitly unavailable.
- `Withdraw Now` is intentionally disabled. Mobile does not invent eligibility, minimums, bank verification, idempotency, confirmation/re-authentication, provider state, or money movement.
- No runnable HTTP wrapper was added for the source-only Chef earnings path because the approved APIM operation still does not exist.
- No dependency, customer-screen, backend, APIM, OpenAPI, database, infrastructure, settlement-admin, bank-identifier, payout-provider, or secret change was made.

### P104 changed code files

- `apps/mobile/src/app/navigation/ChefRootNavigator.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/app/navigation/types.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefPayout/domain/chefPayoutHistoryBoundary.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefPayout/domain/chefPayoutHistoryBoundary.test.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefPayout/screens/ChefPayoutHistoryScreen.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefProfile/screens/ChefProfileScreen.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/features/chefShell/components/ChefHeader.tsx`

Evidence/ledger:

- `docs/mobile-ui-rebuild/P104_CHEF_PAYOUT_HISTORY_UI_WITHDRAW_FLOW.md`
- `build.md`

### P104 validation / guard state

- `GitHub.compare_commits` from phase-start HEAD `3c1981f7d5185d241d0d2b9b0d85a5d6edc753d3` through code end `9c8f1780590e0004199694d1128a6b924d911544` is fast-forward and contains only the seven P104 code/test files listed above.
- The Profile follow-up commit diff was checked separately: it only updates the payout-row message, adds `navigation.navigate('ChefPayoutHistory')`, and normalizes the final newline.
- Focused test source verifies no invented financial state, blocked withdrawal, local tab-state behavior, approved-APIM explanation, and absence of fabricated payout/withdraw/bank route strings.
- Focused Jest test source was added, but Jest execution is not claimed from this connector-only run.
- GitHub Actions are intentionally not claimed as a P104 pass/fail signal because the account's monthly Actions capacity is exhausted and the user explicitly authorized continuing without it.
- Full workspace dependency installation, strict TypeScript, ESLint, Jest execution, production Android bundle/build, emulator/device behavior, performance profiling, and Reference-50 pixel validation are **not recorded as passing or failing for P104** from this connector-only implementation run.
- The authoritative guide identifies Reference 50 as source page 42 / `image50.jpeg`; the direct page-42 visual could not be surfaced through the available File Library multimodal view in this run, so exact pixel comparison is not claimed.
- P104 remains **PARTIAL at full Guide scope** because the required production financial contracts and direct runtime/visual verification are still unavailable; mobile does not fabricate them.

### P104 retained blockers instead of fabricated Guide capabilities

1. No approved APIM mobile exposure for the existing Chef earnings ledger read.
2. No aggregate earnings/payout summary or period semantics.
3. No authoritative available/withdrawable balance.
4. No payout trend/time-series/date-bucket contract.
5. No payout transaction history/detail contract.
6. No masked Chef bank-destination contract.
7. No withdrawal eligibility/minimum/verification contract.
8. No withdrawal-initiation endpoint or idempotency contract.
9. No confirmation/re-authentication/provider status state machine.
10. No authoritative payout-to-Dashboard wallet reconciliation contract.
11. No API-backed pagination/offline/refresh lifecycle for payout history.
12. No recorded direct Reference-50 pixel or Android runtime validation in this connector-only run.

**Next phase in sequence:** **P105 — Chef Subscription Contract — NOT STARTED**.

**Next phase authorization:** **NONE AUTHORIZED**.

**Required action:** Stop after P104. Do not pre-implement P105 without explicit user direction.

## 3. Handoff

Before any P105 work, read `plan.md`, `phases.md`, `agent.md`, this ledger, the full 183-page implementation guide, P104 evidence, and the current Chef Profile/Payout/Dashboard implementations. Preserve the P103/P104 fail-closed financial boundary: do not derive aggregate earnings or available/withdrawable balance from ledger rows; do not invent bank, payout-series, payout-transaction, eligibility, initiation, transaction-detail, settlement, subscription, or billing routes; do not call the backend earnings path from mobile until an approved APIM operation exists; never expose full bank/payment identifiers; do not alter backend/APIM without explicit phase authority; and do not advance beyond the single explicitly authorized phase.
